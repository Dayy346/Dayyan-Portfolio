## Notes for Implementers

- **Do NOT delete** any of the sections or entries above when refactoring.
- **Restructure only if** every item is preserved (e.g. move copy to data.ts but keep it rendered).
- **Adding** new content is fine; **removing or omitting** is not.
- After any change, run through this checklist and tick boxes; fix any unchecked items before merging.
